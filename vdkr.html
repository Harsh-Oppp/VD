    <p id = "para">gayathri arun menon.. even after staying away for this long i still couldn‚Äôt get you out of head.. you‚Äôve managed to live in my heart since 9th grade i hope you know tu kitni special hai mere liye
        i‚Äôll always wait for the day i get to see you again.. <br>  i miss spending every second of my day with you i hope one day we never get to feel this distance again.Even if i have 100s of problems on my head spending time with you always used to brighten my day and princess it still does. I want to feel you in my arms again and i would do anything for that to happen even if it takes me 4 years to see you. I know things went off between us we‚Äôve gone from being the closest to becoming strangers i just want you to know i am not going to let that happen ever again
        you are always ALWAYS going to be my little wormü•∞ i love you‚ô•Ô∏è
